# Ft_ls
A recreation of Unix's ls command in Rust. Inspired by 42's ft_ls exercise, but I decided to use Rust instead of C to learn more about how to deal with the filesystem in Rust.

Usage: install cargo if you haven't already, clone the repo and type

cargo run [path]

or build and run the release version with

cargo build --release
./target/release/ft_ls [path]
